The script takes a BIN code as input from the user, and then it sends a request to the Xbox Live website to see if the code is valid. If the code is valid, the script will print a message saying that the code is active. If the code is not valid, the script will print a message saying that the code is inactive.

The script uses the Requests library to send HTTP requests to the Xbox Live website, and it parses the response using BeautifulSoup to extract the relevant information.

Overall, this script can be useful for people who want to check the validity of Xbox Live codes quickly and easily. However, it's worth noting that using such scripts may violate the terms of service of Xbox Live, and it's important to use them responsibly.
